# mouse-simulator-using-SFML
a mouse simulator using SFML to develop.
This game was a final project for my first programmming course in college, and was done within a month. The code is pretty lengthy because there are actually many duplicates in it and that was because I was not familiar with OOP back then.<br>
This game still has much to improve, so if u have any advice. Just feel free to reach out.

## How to play

To choose between single / multi- player mode, press 1 /2. <br>
Use arrow keys to control characters if there are only one player / you are player 1. <br>
Use WASD to control characters when you are player 2.<br>

## Goal
Control character(s) to avoid obstacles and hit target to obtain points. As points get higher, the speed of the game gets faster and the points obatined when hitting targets also increase. <br>
Be the nimblest mouse!!!

## How to run this code
First, install SFML as the following vid <br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axIgxBQVBg0&t=3s<br>
FYI, I'm using Visual Studio as my IDE and SFML 2.5.1 when developing.<br>
And pack everything (main.cpp and stuff in the resource folder) in visual studio together and follow the instructions in the above vid on how to set SFML in the IDE.

#note: your may need to take a close look at where you store the resouces folder if the game fails to execute properly.
